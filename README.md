# EVAGON

Cache-based networking system for roblox.

## What is special about this game?

It is based on the evidently simple structure of a state system (Rodux). Despite that the system is simple, it is for sure that
many massive applications are derived from simple concepts. The main idea of Evagon is immutable data and simplified
communications. There are a few actions used in it, such as `Dispatch`, which is a way to discard current data and substitute
them with new ones.
